### Step 1: Define the improvement goals
Define specific improvement goals and expectations to the results based on the knowledge gained after the first learning meeting in the project’s initiating phase. There are two types of goals: knowledge goals focusing on better understanding of the development process and the environment it is applied in, and change goals focusing on implementation and evaluation of the effect of specific changes, for example the effect of a new test tool.

### Step 2: Describe the development project
Describe the development project and its environment. In this way future projects may compare their context with this project to consider the relevance of the results. 

### Step 3: Identify the evaluation method
Identify the method to be used to evaluate the result of the improvement project. Three methods are commonly used: comparison with the company’s baseline, comparison with a sister project or comparison of components within the same project.

### Step 4: Make a measurement plan
Make a measurement plan for the project describing the improvement goal, what questions to investigate, what data to collect, when to collect them, who should collect them and how the results should be analysed.
