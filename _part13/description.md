In short the Goal/Question/Metric (GQM) technique is about defining specific improvement goals, ask concrete questions, define metrics, collect measurement data, answer questions and draw conclusions on whether the goals were reached or not. Goal definition in GQM asks for specific viewpoints from which the quality will be analysed. Example viewpoints in use are ‘user’, ‘customer’, ‘manager’, ‘developer’, ‘testers’, ‘development team’ and ‘corporation.’ A GQM model <a class="inline flyer-link" href="#The_steps_of_the_GQM_activities">"(The structure of a GQM model)"</a> contains information necessary to implement goal oriented measurement and analysis. The elements in the model are goals, questions and metrics.

* A goal (see image below) specifies an analytical task that should be achieved using measurement:

“Analyze the <object> for the purpose of <purpose> with respect to <quality focus> from the viewpoint of <viewpoint> in the following environment: <environment>”

* A question expresses a need for information. The answers should contribute to reaching the goal. The form of the questions depends on what we want to achieve. We need information both on quality focus – what we want to know something about – and on the environment – for later interpretation and reuse.

* A metric is a quantitative specification of data or information. Metrics are derived from the questions and contribute the data required for answering them. One or more metrics are needed for each question.
