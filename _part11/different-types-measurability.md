The degree of automation in data collection affects the required effort in data collection as well as the availability and reliability of the measurement data. The more automated the data collection and presentation can be made the more reliably and frequently the data will be available. In addition, by avoiding manual activities in data collection whenever feasible makes the human errors, omissions, and unintentional as well as intentional biases less frequent.

### Measurable with quantitative numbers
The easiest situation is when the desired quality objectives can be measured by numeric metrics. Examples of such metrics are lines of code, code coverage of tests, and numbers of defects. When numeric metrics exist the objective is easy to make visible and track. However, one should still be careful not to make too straightforward conclusions based on seemingly "hard" data.

### Measurable by human assessment
If direct and objective quantitative measurement cannot be found for the objective, it might still be possible to evaluate the objective by human assessment. This assessment can be pure experience based and subjective or based on a more objective assessment criteria. The results of the assessment can be expressed on a numeric scale or reported, e.g., as a written statement of the status of the objective in question. Some examples of metrics that are often hard to measure by objective numeric measures are documentation quality, and many aspects of usability.

### Not measurable
In certain cases the desired objective cannot be measured with specific metrics, and also human assessment might might prove difficult in practice. In these cases, it is still possible to indirectly measure the means of achieving the desired quality. For example, if the desired quality characteristic is maintainability and it is too challenging to directly measure, it could be possible to measure the practices that are used to achieve or improve maintainability. Such as code reviews, refactoring, etc.
