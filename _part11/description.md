The most important aspect in any measurement program is to very explicitly understand and define the purpose of the measurements. Therefore, it should be clear what is the property that is measured, how the measurement data will be used and what is the purpose and goal of the measurements. Common goals of quality measurements include:

* give feedback for developers and track progress
* set standard thresholds and identify deviations
* compare with other persons, teams or organizations

The target of quality measurement can be either the development process or the developed software or system product. The process metrics are typically indirect indicators of software quality and more typical in traditional, document-driven processes. The process metrics are used to ensure that the defined processes are followed. Product metrics, instead, aim at measuring the achieved product quality by more direct means. 

Measurement data can be used on many organizational levels. The simplest is when individual developers, for example, use the data for immediate feedback for their own tasks. The next level is the team level where the data is used inside a team to track, control, or improve the quality or practices by the team itself. When the data is used outside the team, the situation is always more sensitive and also the visibility of how the data is used and by whom requires more careful attention. The frequency of monitoring the measurements results also needs to be considered. It is dependent on the purpose and needs of the collected measurement data. For example, for individual developers, the feedback loop on the low level code quality must be as short as possible, but on the project level quality aspects it might be enough to get the data within some weeks after the project has completed. 

The degree of automation in data collection affects the required effort in data collection as well as the availability and reliability of the measurement data. The more automated the data collection and presentation can be made the more reliably and frequently the data will be available. In becomes also important to recognize that the measurability of quality goals can differ significantly, see attached flyer <a class="inline flyer-link" href="#Different_types_of_measurability">the different types of measurability</a> 

When measurements target individual people and their activities the data is always sensitive. It is important to decide on what level of the organization the data is used and who gets access to it. People must know who is using the measurements and for what purpose. Especially if people feel that they are evaluated, compared, and judged based on some metrics they change their behaviour, intentionally or not, so that the measured attribute gets better - or what they think is better.
