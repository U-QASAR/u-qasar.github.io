Agile metrics (see below) have been used for measuring products, test plans, code, builds, features, requirements, and defects. The emphasis in typical agile metrics is on internal metrics, but external metrics are mainly used on measuring the end product, defects, and the whole software development process. Measuring the resources, i.e., people, directly is rather uncommon in agile way of working. Only team level effectiveness metrics are common. This categorization is illustrative of the actual purposes of agile metrics.#<p><img src="Agile_metrics_classification.png" alt="Agile metrics classification" style="width=100%;height:100%;"><p>
