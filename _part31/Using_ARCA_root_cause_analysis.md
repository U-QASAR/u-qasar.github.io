* Step 1: Target problem detection

The target problem detection step uses the outcome of analysing the measurement results as an input. The analyses of measures help to determine the process improvement opportunities, i.e., target problems that need to be controlled. For example, the analyses could reveal that the technical debt has increased or that the test coverage is insufficiently low. It is important to conclude what happens and where. Timelining and the use of focus groups have been presented as efficient and evidence­based approaches for detecting the target problems. It is also possible to use checklists and questionnaires in order to detect target problems. 

* Step 2: Root cause detection

The root cause detection step uses the detected target problems as an input. In this step, the sources of target problems are detected and considered. The root cause detection step uses both anonymous and public data collection approaches in order to conclude what causes the target problems. There are various tools to enable anonymous data collection, e.g., ARCA­tool and Google Docs. There are also various tools to organize the collected root cause data into a cause­effect diagram. 

* Step 3: Corrective action innovation

The corrective action innovation step uses the outcome of root cause detection as an input. In this step, the process improvement ideas are developed and evaluated. It includes two work phases: root cause selection and corrective action workshop. Root cause selection defines the problems to be controlled. You should use expert opinions while defining the problems. Keep focusing on controllable root causes detected in the Root cause detection step. Corrective
action workshop is a meeting wherein process improvement ideas are developed, evaluated, and analysed. The meeting is prepared by the process improvement facilitator, who selects the key stakeholders to join the meeting. 

* Step 4: Implementing the change 

In order to make improvements, the best process improvement ideas have to be implemented and monitored. Therefore, the results from the target problem detection, root cause detection, and corrective action innovation need to be documented first, and then, communicated over the company members. It is also possible to refine the process improvement ideas by reflecting the analysed target problems and their underlying causes on the capability maturity models and other best practices on software engineering education.
