We now describe some kinds of data, and how they can be harvested. Some data types may be
plentiful. 

One example is project startup data ­ this data is collected once. This typically includes estimated work­hours, project duration and the project contextual data. Of the same type is project closure data ­ collected in the end of the project, this typically includes data on actual resources and time spent on the project. In these situations it is typical to register a lot of information, without disrupting the regular flow of the project. 

Some data should be collected sparsely, as collecting data during the project should be kept low to keep actors focused on the actual tasks. Examples of these are periodic data ­ data like time sheets and burn­down charts are collected periodically. Another example is event­based data ­ the kind of data you collect when special events occur. This may for instance be when reporting a serious bug is or closing a project phase. Typical data are fault and change reports, inspection data and resources used for a phase or an activity. This kind of data can contain a lot of information, but they are also gathered at a cost ­ it is vital that the collection of such data does not happen too often, nor disrupts the actual development process.
