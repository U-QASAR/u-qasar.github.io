Employees must participate in all phases of the measurement program. Lack of project member involvement quickly leads to less internal support of the activity. It is also important to integrate measurements seamlessly with the ordinary project activities. Management also needs to have an active and visible role. They must commit themselves to actively supporting the changes that are suggested as a consequence of the measurement results.

Many types of data can help describe the status and quality of a project. You will probably find that tools that project members use as part of their projectÂ­related activities already collect some of the measurement data you want. Using tools for data collection makes it easier to get a consistent data collection, enabling comparison. 

While automatic collection of data is preferred, some data can only be gathered by manual collection. You should use existing forms if such are present. You can extend these existing forms if you want to collect further information on the same subject.
