Metrics in the Agile and Lean Software development are used for certain main purposes, and it is important to understand the goals and reasons behind using individual metrics when building or using a measurement program in agile context. Metrics can be used for different needs in software development and the focus and goals of measurement differ between agile and more traditional, plan driven, measurement programs. The purpose of measuring agile software development products and activities is divided into five categories (see also <a class="inline flyer-link" href="#Collection_of_Agile_Metrics_for_Specific_Purposes">Collection of agile metrics for specific purposes</a>):
