The validators’ job relies on his/her personal experience and knowledge of the actual project. The check requires a good understanding of the content and intent of the metric and of the environment in which the data were collected. 

Validating data should be done as quickly as possible after the collection. When defining indicators and metrics for a quality objective, an important consideration is the reliability and validity of the defined metrics (LINK TO THE FLYER ­ Evaluating the designed metrics). Before data can be used in measuring, it needs to be validated. This is because a measurement needs accurate and consistent data. In software projects, validation of data is especially important in the startup period, before all project members have reached a common understanding of the metrics. 

The reliability of measures is threatened by all aspects that can cause random or systematic deviations in the measurement data. Such issues affecting the reliability of measurements are, for example, procedures and instruments used for collecting measurement data and the source of data. Human collected or reported data can suffer personal bias or perspective of the collector/reporter. Also the skills, experience, and motivations of the individuals affect the data.
