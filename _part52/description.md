Overall, it is difficult to give precise instruction of what metrics should be used for what purpose. Rather, the development organization should consider their own needs and goals and how to best support those by metrics. Industrial agile teams use metrics suggested by Agile literature, but they also use a lot of customized metrics for their specific needs. These context-dependent metrics are created and used based on a need---as a solution to a problem (see also <a class="inline flyer-link" href="#Changing_our_behaviour_with_metrics">Changing behaviour with metrics</a>).
<p>
The role of documentation, such as design specifications, in Agile mindset is clearly a tool and part of the feature development instead of an individual deliverable as such. This is visible also in the metrics, where documentation is not directly measured or tracked. Instead, the focus is on the actual product and features, which aligns with the first Agile principle, â€œOur highest priority is to satisfy the customer through early and continuous delivery of valuable software.'' 
<p>
An average profile for metric use of an industrial agile team could be described as follows. 

<ol><li>Estimate effort for tasks and follow their progress using velocity. </li>
<li>Measure pre-release quality with number of defects and evaluate the customer satisfaction with some metric.</li>
<li>Develop customized metrics that are needed to solve immediate problems</li></ol>
