There are different kinds of technical debts. Here we define some of the commonly known debts. 

1. Defect debt is about the rate of unfinished defects. It helps to estimate how much work is required in order to improve the promised functionality. 

1. Requirements debt states the rate of unfinished requirements. It helps to estimate how much new feature development is required in order to reach the promised functionality. 

1. Documentation debt is about missing documentation, e.g., a user guide. It states the quality of the transferability over various stakeholders. 

1. Furthermore, architectonic debt is about the maintainability and extendibility of the product. For example, it states missing comment lines, cyclomatic complexity, and modularity.
