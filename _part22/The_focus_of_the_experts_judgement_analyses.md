type: flyer

Considering the product quality, the experts should focus on the architectonic and functional dependencies of the product defects. Considering the process quality, the experts should focus on the project task dependencies. 

For example, with bugs, there is a need to evaluate the infected product features in order to understand what modules needs to be changed in the product and tested after the fixes. Instead, with low test coverage, there is a need to express why the coverage is low resulting to the analyses of task descriptions and priority. This could require consideration of the available effort and schedules too.
