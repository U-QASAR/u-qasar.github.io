title: Elaboration of Indicators & Metrics
order: 4
summary: Here comes the summary
priority: 1
---
1. The objectives are taken under elaboration in the order of voting priority.
1. In the elaboration phase the Objectives are described in more detail by following THE TEMPLATE. In this process the indicators and metrics, if possible are also designed for the Objectives. 
1. The elaboration is best to perform by following a process where each participant first makes the initial description for one of the Objectives individually, acting as the owner of that Objective. After initial description the Objectives are circulated through all participants so that everyone can extend (e.g., propose more/better indicators and metrics), improve, and comment on each Objective description. Finally the owner of an Objective consolidates all the inputs and comments of others into the final Objective description. (The final documentation of the resulting Objective, Indicators and Metrics is usually best to be completed after the workshop. 
1. Brief presentation of each Objective, its Indicators and Metrics by the owner followed by discussion and further refinements, if needed.
