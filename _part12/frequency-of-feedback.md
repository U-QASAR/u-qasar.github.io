Quality indicators and metrics are implemented to get information about the quality of software product and process. The frequency of getting this information, i.e., feedback-loop is a critical characteristic that affect the usefulness of the produced information. Depending on the purpose and needs of the collected measurement data the useful frequency can vary from minutes to weeks or even months. If the measurement is intended to give feedback for the developer on the low level code quality, the feedback loop must be as short as possible; if not immediate at least within minutes form code compile or check-in. On the other hand, if the measurements focus on the project level quality aspects that are evaluated over the whole project-base of the organization it might be enough to get the data within some weeks after the project has completed. Usually, if the measurement data is used for tracking and managing an ongoing project it is better the faster the feedback loop is.
