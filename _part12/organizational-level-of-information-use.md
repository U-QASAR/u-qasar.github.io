When measurements target individual people and their activities the data is always sensitive. It is important to decide on what level of the organization the data is used and who gets access to it. People must know who is using the measurements and for what purpose. Measurement data can be used on many levels. The simplest is when individual developers, for example, use the data for immediate feedback for their own tasks. The next level is the team level where the data is used inside a team to track, control, or improve the quality or practices by the team itself.
When the data is used outside the team, the situation is always more sensitive and also the visibility of how the data is used and by whom requires more careful attention. It is always important to remember, that measuring something affects the measured attribute. Especially if people feel that they are evaluated, compared, and judged based on some metrics they change their behaviour, intentionally or not, so that the measured attribute gets better - or what they think is better.
