The foundation of the U-QASAR Methodology and Platform is the quality model that consists of Quality Objectives that further include one or more Quality Indicators. The Quality Indicators are measured with concrete Metrics. This flyer describes a Quality Objective setting Method (QOS), which goal is to identify, prioritize and elaborate quality objectives in a certain context. The method is a collaborative approach in a workshop setting. The idea is to get as many relevant roles and quality viewpoints represented as possible. This is to ensure that all stakeholders can achieve a shared view of the quality through genuine discussion of the quality objectives. This method relies on a face-to-face workshop, since it is the most efficient way of communication. 

### Step 1: Preparation

* Select the context of the workshop (e.g. a project or software product)  and participants.
* Schedule a workshop meeting and send participants the [introductory material](/files/part12/Handout factsheet.docx)
* Give a pre-assignment to participants: “prepare by using 10-30 minutes to list the most important quality objectives for the product or process from your own viewpoint”

### Step 2: Brainstorming Quality Objectives
* Each participant brainstorms important quality objectives individually using post-it notes (or by using a virtual collaboration tool).
* Participants collect their Post-it notes on the wall and describe the ideas for all. Both the ideas from the pre-assignment and new ideas are collected. 
* Similar and related ideas are grouped to form objectives.
* Additional brainstorming using a company quality model or [reference quality model](/files/part12/Quality objectives - full explanation.docx). 

### Step 3: Prioritization of the Quality Objectives
* After the brainstorming the formed Quality Objectives are collaboratively prioritized by voting.
* Everyone has equal, fixed number of votes . 
* Everyone can give any number of his or her votes to any objective (LINK TO PICTURE of an example objective with post-its and votes).

### Step 4: Elaboration of Indicators & Metrics
* The objectives are taken under elaboration in the order of voting priority.
* In the elaboration phase the Objectives are described in more detail by following the [template](/files/part12/U-QASAR Quality Objective Template.docx). In this process the indicators and metrics, if possible are also designed for the Objectives. 
* The elaboration is best to perform by following a process where each participant first makes the initial description for one of the Objectives individually, acting as the owner of that Objective. After initial description the Objectives are circulated through all participants so that everyone can extend (e.g., propose more/better indicators and metrics), improve, and comment on each Objective description. Finally the owner of an Objective consolidates all the inputs and comments of others into the final Objective description. (The final documentation of the resulting Objective, Indicators and Metrics is usually best to be completed after the workshop. 
* Brief presentation of each Objective, its Indicators and Metrics by the owner followed by discussion and further refinements, if needed. 

### Step 5: Prioritization of the Indicators
* To support the implementation of the measurement program, it is good to prioritize the designed Quality Indicators. It can be done by assessing the impact of and feasibility of each indicator. See the [template](/files/part12/U-QASAR Quality Objective Template.docx).
 
### Step 6: Post workshop activities
* Finalize the descriptions of the Objectives by their owners.
* Analysing the existing data to find out the current level and adjust the thresholds and targets for the quality indicators. 
* Communicate the Objectives among relevant stakeholders.
* Implement the Quality Model (Objectives, Indicators, Metrics) on the [U-QASAR Platform](http://platform.uqasar.eu)
* Set up the monitoring and feedback practices to get the Objectives into actual use.
