An important part of the planning is considering how and for what purpose the collected data is to be used. Some kinds of data may already be collected as part of a tool for system development, such as a product backlog. Other kinds require manual effort.
One important factor is the involvement of project members. They should be part of the work of identifying what measurement data that is collected. The project members have the best knowledge about the project and can help identify the best metrics. They are also the ones responsible for reporting data manually. Further, collected data should not be used to measure individuals. Focus should lie on using data to improve the situation for the whole project group. The scope of the measurement program must be improvement. Employees must not feel that they are being controlled by the measurement. Using collected data to measure individuals will have an effect on the atmosphere of confidence - to the collection process and the people responsible for collecting the data. It is also very important that the project members know that the data is being used for something fruitful – avoid “information graveyards”. This is especially important when data is added manually. If project members experience that nothing good comes out from the registration of the data, they will eventually not bother about the quality of the delivered data.
