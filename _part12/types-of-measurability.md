The measurability of indicators can differ significantly, which naturally affect how the measurements can be implemented and the overall feasibility of the measurement program.

### Measurable with quantitative numbers
The easiest situation is when the desired quality indicators can be measured by numeric metrics. Examples of such metrics are lines of code, code coverage of tests, and numbers of defects. When numeric metrics exist the indicator is easy to make visible and track. However, one should still be careful not to make too straightforward conclusions based on seemingly "hard" data. See the Section 2.5 on reliability and validity of metrics.

### Measurable by human assessment
If direct and objective quantitative measurement cannot be found for the indicator, it might still be possible to evaluate the indicator by human assessment. This assessment can be pure experience based and subjective or based on a more objective assessment criteria. The results of the assessment can be expressed on a numeric scale or reported, e.g., as a written statement of the status of the indicator in question. Some examples of metrics that are often hard to measure by objective numeric measures are code maintainability, and many aspects of usability.

### Not measurable
If the desired indicator cannot be measured with specific metrics, it might still be able to collect subjective estimates or assessments. On the other hand, it is still possible to indirectly measure the means of achieving the desired quality. For example, if the desired quality characteristic is maintainability and it is too challenging to directly measure, it could be possible to measure the practices that are used to achieve or improve maintainability. Such as code reviews, refactoring, etc.
