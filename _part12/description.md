Different stakeholders have different concerns. Inviting them to express their concerns and define relevant quality objectives is likely to add to the range of concerns that are relevant for a given project. A Quality Objective Setting Method is a collaborative way of identifying a relevant set of quality objectives and designing a quality model for an organization or project (LINK TO QOS METHOD FLYER).

A quality viewpoint represents the key concerns of a particular stakeholder or stakeholder group while the quality objective characterizes the software product or process from some quality viewpoint. Viewpoints are a highly abstract idea that allows us to capture a wide variety of issues, aspects and concerns. Defining the quality viewpoints helps to determine:

1. The point in time at which predictions should be carried out and, therefore, what information will be available to define abstractions and measures;
1. The definition of descriptive models for the quality focus, that is the relevant dependent attributes: For example, from the user’s point of view, reliability may be defined as the mean time to failure, whereas, from the tester’s point of view, it may be defined as the number of faults detected over a period of time;
1. What information is costly or difficult to acquire and, consequently, what information should possibly be left out of the model.

Viewpoints are a highly abstract idea that allows us to capture a wide variety of issues, aspects and concerns. What we want to achieve with this variety, is to support the many ways in which viewpoints can be useful in a concrete software project. Each stakeholder has a potentially unique set of concerns. Thus, before embarking in creating a quality model framework, the organization – in cooperation with the project – needs to agree on how this variety is exploited. Two relevant questions for this discussion would be:

* Does the project want to create a unified set of concerns?
* Does the project need to eliminate overlaps in viewpoints, or are overlaps actually a good approach to draw out the relevant concerns towards QA work in the project?

It may be difficult for software organizations to establish good goals from a business perspective and to clearly identify the business relevance of the metrics. Hence, it may be a good idea not to conflate quality viewpoints, but rather elaborate upon the various roles and concerns of the different stakeholders, preferably with rationales etc.
