The target of quality measurement can be either the development process or the developed software or system product. The specific targets for each sets of metrics need to be clearly defined. The process metrics are typically indirect indicators of software quality and more typical in traditional, document-driven processes. The product metrics are used to ensure that the defined processes are followed. This is indirectly believed as leading to high quality end result. Process metrics can also be used for process improvement purposes and tracking progress in terms of adhering to the plans, schedules and deliverables.
Product metrics, instead, aim at measuring the achieved product quality by more direct means. In agile development processes the focus is typically placed on the “running tested features”, and thus, the quality is evaluated by direct measures of the end product. In agile development the quality evaluation is an integral part of the development practices, and not a separate assessment process. This is visible as the emphasized role of customer, frequent and continuous testing, demonstrations, and collaboration among project stakeholders.
