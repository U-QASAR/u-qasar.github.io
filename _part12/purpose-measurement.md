The most important aspect in any measurement program is to very explicitly understand and define the purpose of the measurements. It should be clear what is the property that is measured, how the measurement data will be used and what is the purpose and goal of the measurements. Common goals of quality measurements following

* give feedback for developers and track progress
* set standard thresholds and identify deviations
* compare with other persons, teams or organizations

The purpose of the measurement affects all aspects of data collection, validity of the measurements, interpretations of the results and so on. For example, measurements that are intended for giving fast feedback of the code quality directly to the developers are interpreted very close to the measured target and the context, but project level measurements comparing productivity of different teams can be much more challenging to interpret from outside of the projects.
