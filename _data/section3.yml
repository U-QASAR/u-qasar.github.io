        - guideline: Post­mortem analysis
          description: >
            Post­mortem analysis is a lightweight retrospective method that has been commonly used to determine 1) what went well in the software project, 2) what could be improved in the next project, and 3) how to make it better. It takes positive and negative software development experiences as an input and provides knowledge on how to make it better the next time as an output. Usually, post­mortems are conducted in a group and they can also utilize techniques like Root cause analysis.
        - guideline: Root cause analysis
          description: >
            Root cause analysis is a structured investigation of a problem, which aims to state what changes are needed in the future projects. Root cause analysis takes a problem as an input and provides a set of its perceived cause­and-effect relationships as an output. It creates a causal model, which can be used to explain how the problems are related to one another, ultimately helping to determine process improvement targets. Additionally, the causal model can be used to consolidate and extend the prediction models and project experience questionnaires.

      guidelines:
        - guideline: Automated measurements
          description: >
            In terms of process quality, the most important automated quality control measurement is the test coverage, also known as code coverage. In terms of product quality, the most important automated quality control measurement is the technical debt, which divides into sub­topics of defect debt, requirements debt, documentation debt, and architectonic debt.
        - guideline: Expert judgements
          description: >
            Considering the state of the ongoing project with experts (e.g. architects, senior developers, project managers, quality assurance personnel, etc.) results to in­depth understanding about the project. The automated measurement results regarding the quality goals provide a good starting point for such discussions. Conclude what goes well in the project and what needs to be improved. The aim is to create a bridge between the quality goals and the product and process quality.
