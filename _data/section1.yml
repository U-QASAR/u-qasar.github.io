    - guideline: Define the purpose of the measurement
      description: > 
        The purpose of the measurement affects all aspects of data collection, validity of the measurements, interpretations of the results and so on. For example, measurements that are intended for giving fast feedback of the code quality directly to the developers are interpreted very close to the measured target and the context, but project level measurements comparing productivity of different teams can be much more challenging to interpret from outside of the projects. 
    - guideline: Define the measurement targets
      description: > 
        The target of quality measurement can be either the development process or the developed software or system product. The specific targets for each sets of metrics need to be clearly defined. It becomes important to consider the different types of indicators and metrics that can be linked to the success of their targets. Such artefacts are further used while considering how to measure the state of different quality goals.
    - guideline: Recognize what can be measured
      description: >
        What cannot be recognized cannot be monitored. The easiest situation is when the desired quality indicators can be measured by numeric metrics. If direct and objective quantitative measurement cannot be found for the indicator, it might still be possible to evaluate the indicator by human assessment. If the desired indicator cannot be measured with specific metrics, it might still be able to collect subjective estimates or assessments. 
    - guideline: Consider who will use the measurement results and when that happens.
      description: >
        Measurement data can be used on many organizational levels. Depending on the purpose and needs of the collected measurement data the useful frequency can vary from minutes to weeks or even months.

    - guideline: Consider the sensitivity of the measurements
      description: >
        When measurements target individual people and their activities the data is always sensitive. It is important to decide on what level of the organization the data is used and who gets access to it.
