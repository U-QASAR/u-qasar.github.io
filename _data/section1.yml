      title: Planning a measurement program
      guidelines:
        - guideline: Define the purpose of the measurement
          description: >
            The purpose of the measurement affects all aspects of data collection, validity of the measurements, interpretations of the results and so on. For example, measurements that are intended for giving fast feedback of the code quality directly to the developers are interpreted very close to the measured target and the context, but project level measurements comparing productivity of different teams can be much more challenging to interpret from outside of the projects.
        - guideline: Define the measurement targets
          description: >
            The target of quality measurement can be either the development process or the developed software or system product. The specific targets for each sets of metrics need to be clearly defined. It becomes important to consider the different types of indicators and metrics that can be linked to the success of their targets. Such artefacts are further used while considering how to measure the state of different quality goals.
        - guideline: Recognize what can be measured
          description: >
            What cannot be recognized cannot be monitored. The easiest situation is when the desired quality indicators can be measured by numeric metrics. If direct and objective quantitative measurement cannot be found for the indicator, it might still be possible to evaluate the indicator by human assessment. If the desired indicator cannot be measured with specific metrics, it might still be able to collect subjective estimates or assessments.
        - guideline: Consider who will use the measurement results and when that happens.
          description: >
            Measurement data can be used on many organizational levels. Depending on the purpose and needs of the collected measurement data the useful frequency can vary from minutes to weeks or even months.
        - guideline: Consider the sensitivity of the measurements
          description: >
            When measurements target individual people and their activities the data is always sensitive. It is important to decide on what level of the organization the data is used and who gets access to it.

      title: Setting up the Quality Objectives
      guidelines:
      - guideline: Recognize the important quality viewpoints with different stakeholders
        description: >
          A quality viewpoint represents the key concerns of a particular stakeholder or stakeholder group. Different stakeholders are likely to prioritize software quality differently. Therefore, in order to make an effective measurement program, it also becomes important to start by considering the different viewpoints for software quality collaboratively with the key stakeholders (customers & users, sales & requirements, product & project management, developers & testers, customer service, etc.).
      - guideline: Use formal methods to define quality objectives
        description: >
          Each stakeholder has a potentially unique set of concerns. Thus, before embarking in creating a quality model framework, the organization – in cooperation with the project – needs to agree on how this variety of concerns is exploited.

      title: "Defining the Metrics: GQM method"
      guidelines:
        - guideline: Enable the stakeholder involvement
          description: >
            Involve the project members in the work of identifying what measurement data should be collected.
        - guideline: Be sensitive to your people
          description: >
            Do not use the collected data to measure individuals.
        - guideline: Create an atmosphere of confidence
          description: >
            Create an atmosphere of confidence – to the collection process and the people responsible for collecting the data.
        - guideline: Focus on useful measurements
          description: >
            Use the data for something useful – avoid “information graveyards”.

      title: "Assessing the measurement program"
      guidelines:
        - guideline: Validate the data as soon as possible
          description: >
            Validation of data should be done before all project members have reached a common understanding of the metrics.
        - guideline: Avoid random and systematic deviations
          description: >
            The reliability of measures is threatened by all aspects that can cause random or systematic deviations in the measurement data. The procedures and instruments used for collecting measurement data and the source of data are the usual sources of such deviations.
