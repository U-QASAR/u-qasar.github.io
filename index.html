                    <h2>U-QASAR Methodology Webbook</h2>
                </div>
                <p>This is the Prototype of the U-QASAR Methodology Webbook.
                    The main objective of U-QASAR is to create a flexible Quality Assurance,
                    Control and Measurement methodology to assess the quality of software
                    development projects and their resulting products. The U-QASAR platform
                    enables measurement of the quality of the process and product at any time.</p>
                <p>This webbook is intended as a quick reference of the Methodology Workbook and is composed of 4 sections. The sections describe the most important steps (planning, controlling, and changingt) to implement quality models that reflect the U-Qasar methodology in your institution. Sections are divided in smaller parts. These parts contain clear guidelines and flyers that you can directly use.
                </p>
                <p>To read more about the each of the sections and parts, we have added a reference to the corresponding section in the Methodology Workbook, marked with <span class="glyphicon glyphicon-zoom-in" aria-label="Reference to Methodology Workbook" aria-hidden="true"></span>.
