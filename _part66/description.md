The enhancement services of U-QASAR are utilized to enhance the data obtained from the analytics services and thus create added value to the information and to the user. 
In the Integrated Platform a set of use cases of enhancement services were implemented: suggestions to make changes to quality objectives, quality indicators and metrics based on the con-text. Also the historical data related to a QA project and the trends detected in the data are used to provide different kinds of suggestions to the user. In addition to those the use of the platform is attempted to be made easier due to the enhancement services, e.g. by providing suggestions for suitable configurations based on the context, e.g. user's role in the project, and assist the user in creating a new QA project or suggest for a suitable dashboard setup for a user.
